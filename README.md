# Ryan Light's website

This repository builds my academic website. I followed the instructions from [here](https://www.andreashandel.com/posts/2022-10-01-hugo-to-quarto-migration/) and [here](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/). 

Note to self: To update the website from the terminal in RStudio type - quarto publish netlify.
