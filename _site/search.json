    "text": "I am a sociologist at the University of Oregon researching science, culture, and social networks. I also co-edited The Oxford Handbook of Social Networks.\nMy current research focuses on the organization of science, including scientific movements, environmental social science, and interdisciplinarity, using social network analysis and computational social science methods. I also study how culture and meaning are structured using network and text analysis. I have a longstanding interest in social network analysis and research methods as well as power and inequality.\nI have recently taught undergraduate courses on the sociology of culture, sociology of science, and sociological theory. I also teach graduate-level courses on research methods and social networks."
