    "text": "I am a sociologist at the University of Oregon researching science, culture, and social networks. I also co-edited The Oxford Handbook of Social Networks.\nMy current research focuses on the organization of science, including scientific movements, environmental social science, and interdisciplinarity, using social network analysis and computational social science methods. I also study how culture and meaning are structured using network and text analysis. I have a longstanding interest in social network analysis and research methods as well as power and inequality.\nI have recently taught undergraduate courses on the sociology of culture, sociology of science, and sociological theory. I also teach graduate-level courses on research methods and social networks."

    "text": "Undergraduate Teaching\nSocial Theory (social theory syllabus): This class is a general overview of social theory. Several years ago I began moving beyond teaching the class from the traditional historical perspective and now include empirical examples of good contemporary theorizing.\nCultural Sociology (cultural sociology syllabus): This class is a overview of cultural sociology with a focus on making and consuming culture. I also try to introduce students to long form creative nonfiction in this course.\nSocial Networks (social networks syllabus): This class is an undergraduate course on social network analysis that focuses on several main ideas in the field. We use Gephi to try to reduce barriers to entry.\nScience & Society (science & society syllabus): My first sociology class was a class on “Science & Society” taught by George McCarthy at Kenyon College. It changed my life in a very literal sense and this class is an homage to that one and to Mac.\nSocial Inequality (social inequality syllabus): This is an introductory course on social inequality that functions as an introduction to sociology as well. The course attempts to identify social scientific tools for understanding inequality with a specific focus on the United States."

It differs from “traditional” methods courses that spend a good deal of time working through specific methods (e.g., surveys, ethnography) and focuses instead on things like developing reading strategies, evaluating research, and understanding the landscape of professional research social science.\nSocial Network Analysis (sna syllabus and website): This is a hands-on class on social network analysis in R. We read stuff and workshop programming. This class has led to multiple publications, MA theses, and PhD chapters. All of the course materials are freely available on the course website.\nPublishing Seminar (publishing seminar syllabus): This is a publication workshop that focuses on bringing a single manuscript to publication."
